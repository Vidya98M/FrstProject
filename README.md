This is an earthquake detection system, in this using the accelerometer which detects vibrations in the earth's surface. When the device moves the arduino recieves an nput and sends that to the buzzer. 
This is a basic project which is actually extremely useful. It is used to detect a possible earthquake that might occur.

For this project the components we need are :-

1) Arduino Uno,

2) accelerometer,

3) Buzzer, and

4) Male to Female wires.
